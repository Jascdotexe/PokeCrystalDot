So what I need help with is I previously taksed you with creating these moves:

    move EFFECT_STEALTH_ROCK,        0, ROCK,          STATUS,     100, 20,   0     ; STEALTH_ROCK
    move EFFECT_U_TURN,             70, BUG,           PHYSICAL,   100, 20,   0     ; U_TURN
    move EFFECT_TRICK_ROOM,          0, PSYCHIC_TYPE,  STATUS,     100,  5,   0     ; TRICK_ROOM
    move EFFECT_SUCKER_PUNCH,       70, DARK,          PHYSICAL,   100,  5,   0     ; SUCKER_PUNCH


    as well as their move effects:

    StealthRock:
    checkobedience
    usedmovetext
    doturn
    checkhit
    setstealthrock
    endmove
    
    UTurn:
    checkobedience
    usedmovetext
    doturn
    critical
    damagestats
    damagecalc
    stab
    damagevariation
    checkhit
    moveanim
    failuretext
    applydamage
    criticaltext
    supereffectivetext
    checkfaint
    buildopponentrage
    kingsrock
    forceplayerswitch
    endmove
    
    TrickRoom:
    checkobedience
    usedmovetext
    doturn
    checkhit
    settrickroom
    endmove
    
    SuckerPunch:
    checkobedience
    usedmovetext
    doturn
    checksuckerpunch
    critical
    damagestats
    damagecalc
    stab
    damagevariation
    checkhit
    moveanim
    failuretext
    applydamage
    criticaltext
    supereffectivetext
    checkfaint
    buildopponentrage
    kingsrock
    endmove
    

    Currently, they ALL only make the user flinch, and then proceed to crash the game. Can we take a look and fix?
