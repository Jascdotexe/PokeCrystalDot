Just a pesonal project to learn how to use decomps and GitHub, using the PokeCrystal16-NewBox version as a base.

Credit to pret & everyone involved in making the decomps, and the 16-bit Newbox version specifically, as well as the tutorials made for PokeCrystal.

Credit to @nuukiie for the sprites for new Pokemon.
