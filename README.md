Just a pesonal project to learn how to use decomps and GitHub, using the PokeCrystal16-NewBox version as a base. Personally, I know very little of actual coding. But have learned more than I thought possible. I don't know if there will ever be an offical "release", but at some point I'll consider it good enough.

Credit to pret, aaaaaa123456789 & everyone involved in making the decomps, and the 16-bit Newbox version specifically, as well as the tutorials made for PokeCrystal.

Credit to @nuukiie for the sprites for new Pokemon.
